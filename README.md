# New-block-cipher-algorithm-for-Text-and-Image-encryption-and-decryption
The overall implementation is for both text and image encryption and decryption algorithm. Text encryption
and image encryption make up the two main components of the implemented code. The user is given the
option of encrypting either text or an image.
1- The algorithm reads the user's input for text encryption and determines whether it is longer than the
permitted 16 characters. The user is asked to enter a proper message if the input is lengthier. The
program then generates a key depending on the user's input or one automatically if the input is
incorrect. To make sure the key adheres to the necessary format, it is verified and updated. Based
on the original key, the Round_Key function creates a series of round keys. Using the created round
keys, the encryption function encrypts the text, and the decryption function decrypts it.
2- The code asks the user to choose an image file in order to encrypt images. The chosen image is
reduced in size to 256x256 pixels and made grayscale. The image data is then changed into a format
that can be encrypted. A key that must be entered by the user is then validated and changed in a
manner akin to how text is encrypted. The Encryption function encrypts the image data using a set
of round keys that were generated by the Round_Key function. In order to recover the original
image, the decryption function turns back the encryption process.
Overall flow of code is given below:
- Start from Repeat
- Ask the user whether they want "text" or "image" encryption
- When "text" is selected:
o ask the user to input a text message
o check to see if the message is longer than 16 characters
o Ask the user to write a legitimate message.
o Create or verify the encryption key
o Encrypt the text
o Decrypt the text
- Suppose "image" is picked:
o A prompt asking the user to choose an image file
o resizing and grayscale conversion
o Create or verify an encryption key
o Transform picture data for encryption
o Encrypt and decrypt images, and perform image decryption.
- Request another encryption attempt from the user
- End if "no" is selected.
